To check if the JDK is installed before installing the package, you can add a preinstall script to your package.json file. Here's an example of how you can modify the scripts section in your package.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "name": "oarm-simulator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A wrapper library for the Oarm simulator app",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "preinstall": "java -version || (echo 'JDK not found, please install the JDK and try again.' && exit 1)"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    // Dependencies go here
  },
  "bin": {
    "oarm-sim": "./cli.js"
  }
}
In this example, the preinstall script checks if the java command (which is part of the JDK) is available on the system. If it is not found, the script prints an error message and exits with an error code (exit 1), which will prevent the package from being installed.

Note that this check only verifies that the JDK is installed and available in the system PATH. It doesn't verify that the specific version of the JDK required by your project is installed. If your project requires a specific JDK version, you may need to add additional checks or requirements to your package installation process.
